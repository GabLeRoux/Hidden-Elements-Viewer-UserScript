Hidden Elements Viewer - UserScript
===================================

A Greasemonkey User Script that let you find hidden tags quickly

Description
-----------

Hidden Elements Viewer is a small project that has a simple goal; help us find some hidden stuff. You got it, it's a simple plugin that reveal some html elements with popular css technics. The goal behind this is to find some issues on some ajax applications, letting us click on some hidden buttons. Pretty simple eh?

<i>Note: This script has been tested on Firefox, but may work on other userscript browsers such as Chrome or Opera.</i>

Usage
-----

Simply install the script with Greasemonkey (will add a quick way to do it soon) and activate it. Click on the main switch to show the sidebar and enjoy clicking on some switches.

Requirements
------------

* A [web browser](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) compatible with Greasemonkey or userscripts
* [Greasemonkey plugin](http://www.greasespot.net/)

Disclaimer
----------

Hidden Elements Viewer does not encourage hacking, this plugin is delivered as-is to help people finding bugs and that's all :)
